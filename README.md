# Open Letter to Tech Workers in Barcelona 

## What is happening?

We are a group of tech workers in Barcelona that want to take part in the [#GlobalClimateStrike](https://globalclimatestrike.net) between the 20th and 27th September. We want to show our support for [Fridays for Future Barcelona](https://twitter.com/f4f_barcelona) and the school strike movement. We also want to recognise the role played by the tech industry in the climate crisis and show that we are committed to finding solutions.

## Why?

The tech industry is one of the industries having a major impact on the climate crisis. The data centers that power the apps and websites we use are currently responsible for about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making its emissions on par with the aviation industry and even projected to exceed it in 2020.
